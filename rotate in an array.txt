Algorithm
- Declare and initialise an array

- Variable n will get from user the number of
 time an array should be rotated towards its
 left

- The array can be rotated by shifting its 
element to a position prior to them which can
 be accomplished by looping through the array 
and perform the operands arr[i]=arr[j+1]

- The first element of array will be added to 
the last of the rotated array

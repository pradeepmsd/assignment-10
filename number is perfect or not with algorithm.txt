n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
sum1 = 0
for i in range(1, n):
    if(n % i == 0):
        sum1 = sum1 + i
if (sum1 == n):
    print(" The number is a Perfect ")
else:
    print(" The number is not a Perfect ")





algorithm:

  - Enter the integer and stote it in a variable.
  - Then for loop can used to generate numbers from 1 to n
  - if statement can be used to check the numbers it is divided by i gives the remainder as 0.
  - Then proper divisors of the number are added to the sum variable.
  - if sum of the proper divisors of numbers is equal to the original number,that number is a perfect number.
  - The final result is printed.
